    <h2>About Game</h2>
    <p>The Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented in 1970 by British mathematician, John Conway.
    It is a zero-player game,  meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state. It consists of
    a grid of cells that can live, die or multiply based on a set of mathematical rules. For more info go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">here!</a>
